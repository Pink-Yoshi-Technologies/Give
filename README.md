# Give

## Project Description
This project, developed by **Pink Yoshi Technologies**, is called **Give** — a social decision-making website designed to help indecisive users make everyday choices with the support of their communities. Users can create posts with their options and create polls within groups, allowing friends and peers to vote and provide quick, visual feedback.

This project is associated with the **University of Auckland SOFTENG 310** course.

## What does this project do?
**Give** is a social decision-making website that provides a simple and interactive platform where users can create posts including photos and links of options they are undecided about — whether it's choosing an outfit, picking a restaurant, or deciding on a movie. Friends, family, or community members within their groups can vote in polls to help them

## Why is this project useful?
**Give** is designed for people who struggle with indecision and want instant feedback from their trusted circles. Instead of endless back-and-forth messages or being stuck in choice paralysis, users can post a poll and get clear, visual input from their groups. It’s a fun, social way to make everyday decisions easier, while also fostering engagement and interaction within communities.
